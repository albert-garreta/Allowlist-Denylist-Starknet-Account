# allowlist_denylist_account

This is part of a project presented at StarkNet's hackathon (Amsterdam, 2022), and which finished 3rd place. The full repository is here: [Brewery Store](https://github.com/team-brewery/wallet-app-store)

This is a custom Starknet account contract that allows to set lists of allowed and forbidden addresses and a security mode. Then, depending on the security mode, the contract will revert transactions deemed insecure.
